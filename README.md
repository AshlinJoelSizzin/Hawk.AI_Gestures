# Hawk.AI_Gestures

Welcome to the Hawk AI Gesture Recognition System repository, a vital part of the Hawk AI platform. This repository hosts the hand gesture recognition technology, which enables users to place food orders in restaurants by performing unique hand gestures. Hawk AI is designed to make ordering food an effortless and futuristic experience, utilizing AI, machine learning, and deep learning to recognize hand movements in real-time.

## Symbolism and Name
The Hawk AI name is inspired by the sharp vision and keen observation skills of a hawk. Just like a hawk observes its environment to gather food, Hawk AI observes human gestures to facilitate food ordering. The "AI" represents the artificial intelligence powering this system, making it intuitive, fast, and responsive.

## Current Status
The repository contains the code for detecting and recognizing various hand gestures using the following technologies:

* OpenCV
* MediaPipe
* Hand tracking and Gesture Detection modules

This technology will be integrated into the Hawk AI food ordering system, enabling users to place orders with simple hand gestures through a camera.

## Features
* **Real-time hand tracking**: Utilizing MediaPipe's hand detection technology, the system tracks hand movements and identifies key landmarks.
* **Gesture recognition**: Custom gestures such as "Cheers," "Rock," "Love," and directional gestures (e.g., forward and backward) are detected.
* **User interaction**: As gestures are recognized, the corresponding food items will be displayed, allowing users to interact with the menu hands-free.

## Snapshots
Below are the snapshots of each unique gesture in action.
